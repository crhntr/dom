This package has pure Go implementation of some Document Object Model functions using [golang.org/x/net/html.Node](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html).

It makes use of the awesome package [andybalholm/cascadia](https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia).

The spec pacakge specifies interfaces; dom has implementations.
