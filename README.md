# dom [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/crhntr/dom.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/crhntr/dom)

This package has pure Go implementation of some Document Object Model functions using [golang.org/x/net/html.Node](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html).

I often use this for testing HTML coming back from servers. I also am using it in [Muxt](https://github.com/crhntr/muxt). If you like HTML and hypertext, definitely give it a try.

It makes use of the awesome package [andybalholm/cascadia](https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia).

The spec package specifies interfaces; dom has implementations.
